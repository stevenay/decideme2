# DecideMe - Online Social Decision Making App

We always have to make decision in our daily life. We usually ask the suggestions and advices from our family, relatives, friends and colleagues before making our decision. Normally, we do this activity with our Phone, Facebook or (right) Teashop meetup.

DecideMe is where you can post your options about the decision and people (you invited) can vote which option may be most suitable for your personal. That's not like random online polling.

For example, you want to purchase the shirt but you're not sure whether white or red shirt is more suited with your appearance. You can invite people (whom you think they can help you decide) about your purchase. They will give you vote to each of your option. Then you can see which shirt get the most votes and most suited for you. Yeah, right! Final decision is yours.
